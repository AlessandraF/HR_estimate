# HR_estimate V.0

The Source Code allows you to estimate the Heart Rate from a smartphone camera.
The folder contains two MATLAB functions. The fist one - called LoadVideo.m - allows you to import the recorded video recorded via smartwatch. The second one - called HR_estimate - allows you to give an estimate of your HR. 

Data Acquisition procedure: i) place your fingertip exactly on the camera, you need to cover it all; ii) do touch the camera, but limit pressure. It's important to touch it gently, otherwise too much pressure will impede blood flow (which is what needs to be measured); iii) try to record using 30-60 second video.
