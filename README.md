# HR_estimate V.0

The Source Code allows you to estimate your Heart Rate from a simple smartphone camera.
The repository contains two MATLAB functions. The fist one - called LoadVideo.m - allows you to import the recorded video. 
The second one - called HR_estimate - gives an estimate of your HR. 

Data Acquisition procedure: i) place your fingertip exactly on the camera, you need to cover it all; ii) do touch the camera, but with limited pressure. It's important to touch it gently, otherwise too much pressure will impede blood flow (which is what needs to be measured); iii) try to record using 30-60 second video.

PS This is the Dropbox link to one of mine recordings (I used an iphone 5 with a frame rate of 30fps).   https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkx9ddykql1gvpf/IMG_9114.MOV?dl=0
